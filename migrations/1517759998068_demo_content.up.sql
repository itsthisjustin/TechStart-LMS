In 2009, the W3C allowed the XHTML 2.0 Working Group''s charter to expire and decided not to renew it. W3C and WHATWG are currently working together on the development of HTML5.</p>  <p>The Mozilla Foundation and Opera Software presented a position paper at a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) workshop in June 2004, focusing on developing technologies that are backward compatible with existing browsers, including an initial draft specification of Web Forms 2.0. The workshop concluded with a vote—8 for, 14 against—for continuing work on HTML. Immediately after the workshop, the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) was formed to start work based upon that position paper, and a second draft, Web Applications 1.0, was also announced. <strong><em>The two specifications were later merged to form HTML5</em></strong>. The HTML5 specification was adopted as the starting point of the work of the new HTML working group of the W3C in 2007.</p>  <p>On 14 February 2011, the W3C extended the charter of its HTML Working Group with clear milestones for HTML5. In May 2011, the working group advanced HTML5 to "Last Call", an invitation to communities inside and outside W3C to confirm the technical soundness of the specification. The W3C developed a comprehensive test suite to achieve broad interoperability for the full specification by 2014, which was the target date for recommendation. In January 2011, the WHATWG renamed its "HTML5" living standard to "HTML". The W3C nevertheless continued its project to release HTML5.</p>  <p>In July 2012, WHATWG and W3C decided on a degree of separation. W3C will continue the HTML5 specification work, focusing on a single definitive standard, which is considered as a "snapshot" by WHATWG. The WHATWG organization will continue its work with HTML5 as a "Living Standard". The concept of a living standard is that it is never complete and is always being updated and improved. New features can be added but functionality will not be removed.</p>  <p>In December 2012, W3C designated HTML5 as a Candidate Recommendation. The criterion for advancement to W3C Recommendation is "two 100% complete and fully interoperable implementations".</p>  <p>On 16 September 2014, W3C moved HTML5 to Proposed Recommendation.</p>  <p>On <strong><em>28 October 2014</em></strong>, HTML5 was released as a stable W3C Recommendation, bringing the specification process to completion.</p>  <p>On <strong><em>1 November 2016</em></strong>, HTML5.1 was released as a stable W3C Recommendation.</p>', 5, 1);

An input can only be in one form), <strong>formmethod</strong> (A string indicating which HTTP method (GET or POST) should be used when submitting; it overrides the method of the &lt;form&gt; element, if defined.

<p>HTML5 provides syntax and API items to support client-side validation of forms.

<h5>8. String Operators</h5>
<p>There are two string operators. The first is the <strong>concatenation operator, "<em>.</em>"</strong>, which returns the concatenation of its right and left arguments. The second is the <strong>concatenating assignment operator, "<em>.=</em>"</strong>, which appends the argument on the right side to the argument on the left side.</p>

<h4>if</h4>
<p>The if construct is one of the most important features of many languages, PHP included. It allows for conditional execution of code fragments. PHP features an if structure that is similar to that of C:</p>
<pre><code>
if (expr)
  statement
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example: </strong></p>
<p>The following example would display a is bigger than b if $a is bigger than $b</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;?php
if ($a &gt; $b)
  echo "a is bigger than b";
?&gt;
</code></pre>
<h4>else</h4>
<p>Often you&#8217;d want to execute a statement if a certain condition is met, and a different statement if the condition is not met. This is what else is for.</p>
<p><strong>Example: </strong></p>
<p>following code would display a is greater than b if $a is greater than $b, and a is NOT greater than b otherwise:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;?php
if ($a &gt; $b) {
  echo "a is greater than b";
} else {
  echo "a is NOT greater than b";
}
?&gt;
</code></pre>
<h4>elseif/else if</h4>
<p>elseif, as its name suggests, is a combination of if and else. Like else, it extends an if statement to execute a different statement in case the original if expression evaluates to FALSE. However, unlike else, it will execute that alternative expression only if the elseif conditional expression evaluates to TRUE.</p>
<p><strong>Example: </strong></p>
<p>For example, the following code would display a is bigger than b, a equal to b or a is smaller than b:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;?php
if ($a &gt; $b) {
    echo "a is bigger than b";
} elseif ($a == $b) {
    echo "a is equal to b";
} else {
    echo "a is smaller than b";
}
?&gt;
</code></pre>
<h4>while</h4>
<p>while loops are the simplest type of loop in PHP. They behave just like their C counterparts. The basic form of a while statement is:</p>
<pre><code>
while (expr)
    statement
</code></pre>
<h4>do-while</h4>
<p>do-while loops are very similar to while loops, except the truth expression is checked at the end of each iteration instead of in the beginning. The main difference from regular while loops is that the first iteration of a do-while loop is guaranteed to run. The syntax of a do-while loop is:</p>
<pre><code>
do {
    code;
} while (condition is true);
</code></pre>
<h4>for</h4>
<p>for loops are the most complex loops in PHP. They behave like their C counterparts. The syntax of a for loop is:</p>
<pre><code>
for (expr1; expr2; expr3)
    statement
</code></pre>
<p>The first expression (expr1) is evaluated (executed) once unconditionally at the beginning of the loop. In the beginning of each iteration, expr2 is evaluated. If it evaluates to TRUE, the loop continues and the nested statement(s) are executed. If it evaluates to FALSE, the execution of the loop ends. At the end of each iteration, expr3 is evaluated (executed).</p>
<p><strong>Example: </strong></p>
<p>following example displays number 1 to 10</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;?php
for ($i = 1; $i <= 10; $i++) {
    echo $i;
}
?&gt;
</code></pre>
<h4>foreach</h4>
<p>The foreach construct provides an easy way to iterate over arrays. foreach works only on arrays and objects, and will issue an error when you try to use it on a variable with a different data type or an uninitialized variable. There are two syntaxes:</p>
<pre><code>
foreach (array_expression as $value)
    statement
</code></pre>
<pre><code>
foreach (array_expression as $key => $value)
    statement
</code></pre>
<h4>switch</h4>
<p>The switch statement is similar to a series of IF statements on the same expression. In many occasions, you may want to compare the same variable (or expression) with many different values, and execute a different piece of code depending on which value it equals to. This is exactly what the switch statement is for.</p>
<p><strong>Example: switch structure</strong></p>
<pre><code>
&lt;?php
switch ($i) {
    case 0:
        echo "i equals 0";
        break;
    case 1:
        echo "i equals 1";
        break;
    case 2:
        echo "i equals 2";
        break;
}
?&gt;
</code></pre>', 20, 4);
INSERT INTO topic_details (topic_id, topic_name, topic_content, topic_points, module_id) VALUES (16, 'Functions', '<h4>User-defined functions</h4>
<p>A function may be defined using syntax such as the following:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;?php
function foo($arg_1, $arg_2, /* ..., */ $arg_n)
{
    echo "Example";
    return $retval;
}
?&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, $arg_1, $arg_2, /* ..., */ $arg_n represents <strong>argument list</strong>. Information may be passed to functions via the argument list, which is a comma-delimited list of expressions. The arguments are evaluated from left to right. $retval represents the returning value of the function. Values are returned by using the optional <strong>return statement</strong>. Any type may be returned, including arrays and objects. This causes the function to end its execution immediately and pass control back to the line from which it was called. Any valid PHP code may appear inside a function, even other functions and class definitions.</p>
<h4>Internal (built-in) functions</h4>
<p>PHP comes standard with many functions and constructs. There are also functions that require specific PHP extensions compiled in, otherwise fatal "undefined function" errors will appear. For example, to use image functions such as imagecreatetruecolor(), PHP must be compiled with GD support. Or, to use mysql_connect(), PHP must be compiled with MySQL support. There are many core functions that are included in every version of PHP, such as the string and variable functions. A call to phpinfo() or get_loaded_extensions() will show which extensions are loaded into PHP.</p>

INSERT INTO topic_details (topic_id, topic_name, topic_content, topic_points, module_id) VALUES (17, 'HTML form handling', '<p>One of the most powerful features of PHP is the way it handles HTML forms. The basic concept that is important to understand is that any form element will automatically be available to your PHP scripts. i.e. When a form is submitted to a PHP script, the information from that form is readily available. There are few ways to access this information, for example:</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A simple HTML form for login</p>
<pre><code>
form action=&quot;home.php&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot;&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Username: &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;username&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Password: &lt;input type=&quot;password&quot; name=&quot;pass&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Login&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>When the user fills in this form and hits the submit button, the home.php page is called. In this file you would write something like this:</p>
<p><em>home.php</em></p>
<pre><code>
Welcome &lt;?php echo htmlspecialchars($_POST[&#8217;username&#8217;]); ?&gt;.
</code></pre>
<p>Apart from the <em>htmlspecialchars()</em> it should be obvious what this does. <em>htmlspecialchars()</em> makes sure any characters that are special in html are properly encoded so people can&#8217;t inject HTML tags or Javascript into your page. The <strong>$_POST[&#8217;username&#8217;]</strong> variable will be automatically set for you by PHP. You don&#8217;t want to print the user password, right? you can store password using, <strong>$_POST[&#8217;pass&#8217;]</strong>. $_POST is a superglobal which contains all POST data. Notice how the <em>method of our form is POST</em>. If we used the <em>method GET</em> then our form information would live in the <strong>$_GET superglobal</strong> instead (Remember that, when you want to submit some sensitive information such as password, never use the GET method). You may also use the $_REQUEST superglobal, if you do not care about the source of your request data. It contains the merged information of GET, POST and COOKIE data.</p>
<p>Using a GET form is similar except you&#8217;ll use the appropriate GET predefined variable instead. GET also applies to the QUERY_STRING (the information after the &#8217;?&#8217; in a URL). So, for example, http://www.example.com/page.php?id=1 contains GET data which is accessible with $_GET[&#8217;id&#8217;].</p>
